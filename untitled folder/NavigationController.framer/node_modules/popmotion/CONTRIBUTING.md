## Features

Redshift aims to keep filesize to a minimum while being highly extendable. If you've created a [new route](http://redshiftjs.com/api/redshift/addroute) or [rubix processor](http://redshiftjs.com/api/redshift/addrubix), publish it on NPM and send us a link.

If you want to add a feature directly to Redshift, get in touch and we can talk about the best place for it.

## Bugfixes

Try and keep within the style established throughout the codebase, and then just open a pull request!
